# Mix Match CIFAR10 on PyTorch

This repository showcases using PyTorch to implement MixMatch on the CIFAR10
dataset. Much of the original implementation is based on
[YU1ut/MixMatch-pytorch](https://github.com/YU1ut/MixMatch-pytorch/tree/master)
however, we've refactored the code to follow more modern PyTorch practices.
